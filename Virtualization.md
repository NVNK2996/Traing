# Virtualization

## 1.Introduction to Virtualization

Virtualization is a technology that allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical server,
each with its own operating system and applications.
This concept has revolutionized the way we use computing resources, making it more efficient, cost-effective, and scalable.

Explanation of the Diagrams:

Traditional Way:

Each server (Server 1, Server 2, Server 3) is dedicated to a single application (Email, Web, Database).
Each server runs a different operating system tailored for its specific application.

Virtualization Way:

A single physical server runs a hypervisor.
The hypervisor creates multiple virtual machines (VM1, VM2, VM3).
Each virtual machine runs its own operating system and application, mimicking the traditional setup but on a single physical server.

## 2.Traditional vs. Virtualized Environment

In a traditional computing environment, each server runs a single operating system and application,
resulting in underutilized resources and increased hardware costs.
Virtualization solves this problem by allowing multiple VMs to share the same physical server,
maximizing resource utilization and reducing hardware needs.

## 3.Hypervisors

A hypervisor is software that creates and runs VMs, allocating and controlling the sharing of a machine's resources.
There are two types of hypervisors: Type 1 (bare metal) and Type 2 (hosted).
Type 1 hypervisors are installed directly on the server hardware,
while Type 2 hypervisors are installed on top of an existing operating system.

## 4.Benefits of Virtualization

Virtualization offers several benefits, including:

Hardware consolidation and cost savings
Improved resource utilization and efficiency
Enhanced flexibility and scalability
Simplified management and maintenance
Improved disaster recovery and backup capabilities

## 5.Conclusion

In conclusion, virtualization is a powerful technology that has transformed the way we use computing resources.

By understanding the concept of virtualization, the different types of hypervisors, and the benefits of virtualization,
we can unlock the full potential of our computing infrastructure.
